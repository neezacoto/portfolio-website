# Portfolio Website
This was done during my second year 2022 spring break. I had just finished a MERN stack CRUD project in a team at Hack.Diversity. I was limited to completing some UI, and got a lot done, but I wasn't fully aware how React worked. I was sort of stuck in my corner coding my one functionality. So, over the spring break I practiced a dummy website following a tutorial, then I tried recreating my own navbar & playing around with navigation. I did this because I find it key to immediatly try to recall information that I just learned to test myself. I got comfortable and learned a lot about creating react apps. I became familiar with some of the work patterns that I would go through through setting up a React application/problem I was trying to solve. I deciceded to drop the navbar project and build a portfolio. This was exciting because this would be my first ever website hosted. From there I grinded endlessly for three days, finishing on the sunday before school. It was crazy fun and I learned a lot! I was very impressed with what I acomplished having just learned React.

#### This is the original mockup I did on figma.
