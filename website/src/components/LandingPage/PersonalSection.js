                                Other than spending my free time on coding, you'll find me involved in the arts and taking in nature.<br/><br/>
                                When it comes to art, my medium of choice is digital, with a mix of cartoon/semi-realism. I've been designing
                                and doing art for as long as I can remember. It comes in handy when working on coding projects, because
                                I'm always laser focused on functionality and presentation. I believe that someone can create an amazing tool, 
                                but if the design isn't there, it all falls apart.<br/><br/> My favorite part about the outdoors are the clouds. It feels
                                absolutely surreal to have these giants in the sky, looking as if they painted. Nature as a whole I believe is something beautiful, 
                                becaues no one moment is ever the sameâ€”ever fleeting, ever beautiful.
                            </p> */}

                                    To the left is my art & photography.<br></br>Off the books I rather love spending my time getting involved in hobby hunting or you'll find me taking in nature.<br/><br/>
									Biking, running, Mixed-Calisthenics, Rock-climbing... Fitness & health is important to me.
                                    I've gone from watercolors, to digital art, to photography. In my hobbies I would consider my self a jack of all trades knowing photo editing and video editing.<br/><br/>
									I feel as though all these mishmash of skills help me thrive in any environment I'm placed in. I always figure out a way even when my back is against the wall; there is always a solution to be found.
									And in quarrels and disputes a bridge to be made.<br></br> My approach to all problems include an array of visual elements and analogies, breaking things down into their smallest components to understand the whole.<br>
									</br><br></br>That's why I stay by computer science, it gives my brain something good to chew on, and every problem solved a treat well deserved.
